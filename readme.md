# Code Louisville Front-End Project

## Main features
Showcases an understanding of HTML, CSS, and JS to build a webpage.

## Feature Requirements met
- A navigation menu that collapses into a responsive mobile-friendly menu (such as a “hamburger” menu) 
- Create a form that takes in at least two fields of information and validates input (for example, it checks to ensure email is the a@b.com format
- Create a JavaScript function whose return value is used in your site. The function must be triggered by user action (ex: clicking a button).
- Use JavaScript to perform math operations and display the result on your site.
- Use “:nth child” CSS to style a series of elements (for example, change the color of every 2nd item in a list).

## Additional Requirements met
- Your project is responsive to different devices and/or browser sizes and improves the user experience in some way
- - We will look at your app on a desktop screen and a mobile device to see what changes occur
- - We must be able to see the change that your code is making on your website - a media query can be written correctly but have no actual effect. That will not be ok in this class.
- Your project includes at minimum 3 custom-written CSS elements (selectors, classes, etc) located in a .css file which are applied to your HTML elements
The CSS must be included in its own file, not “in-line” on your HTML page - we want to see that you can properly “link” a stylesheet
Many of the options in the first requirement will also fulfil this requirement
- Your project includes JavaScript in a separate .js file
Script tags in your HTML file must execute the JS file
Many of the options in the first requirement will also fulfil this requirement
- Your code have comments that document major sections of your code to make it easier to read
You don’t need to go crazy on this - a few code comments are perfectly fine
- Your project code is uploaded to your GitHub account, in its own repository, with at least 5 commits
We need to see that you’ve used Git to update your GitHub profile at least 5 times
Using GitHub’s file uploader does not count as a check-in. You must upload via Git. 
- It must include a README file located at the top level directory of your project that includes:
A description of your project
What features you chose to included (so we know what to look for)
Any special instructions we might need to run your project
