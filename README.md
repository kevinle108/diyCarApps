# Code Louisville Front-End Project

## Description
- For people who change their own oil, deciding which motor oil to buy is often a headache since motor oil is often sold at different amounts (a single qt, 5 qts, a 12pk of single qts, etc...) and varying prices. Also, the change interval for conventional oil is every 3,000 miles while synthetic oil is every 5,000 miles. This website helps simplifies all this by calculating the oil cost/mile to help determine which motor oil is more cost-effective. There also a fuel economy calculator.
